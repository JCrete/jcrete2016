In our project we use the JPL interface for querying prolog, as described in this blog entry:

However, there are performance issues as the interface imposes a certain overhead which is iritating.

Yarda proposed the use of graalvm for running interpreters (now available for javascript, ruby and r) written using truffle:
https://github.com/graalvm
https://github.com/graalvm/truffle

There was a question on whether Prolog is available in graal and how the app can be distributed.

Yarda said that we need to implement a interpeter for Prolog in graal. Regarding packaging, with JVM 9 it will be just aonther jar file. 
Until then, however, one needs to require to download a new virtual machine GraalVM + OTN (Oracle Technology Network):
