## Adding Materials

Please create a subfolder with a short title of your session without special characters and spaces under the folder for the day. If you have only text, markdown is preferred. Then please add a link to the schedule.

Please create a README.md in that folder, saying who was the convenor of the session.

If you don't want to add the materials directly because you already have them available elsewhere you can just link them from the schedule.
